##### Memo Hawaii dataset #####

The Next Generation Sequencer produced millions of DNA sequences (here called "reads").
Similar reads were merged into one biologically correct unique sequence (here called "haplotype").
Species boundary was difined based on sequence similarity (ABGD algorithm, Puillandre et al. 2012).
It is expected that one species may have more than one haplotype, but some species have only one haplotype.

# Variables
order: (rough) taxonomic category
status: native, invasive, or unknown
mean.within: mean of within species genetic distance. If a species has only one haplotype, the mean is zero (i.e., no genetic distance within species)
max.within: maximum of intra specific genetic distance
n.haplo: number of haplotypes within species
min.between: minimum of between species genetic distance (i.e., genetic distance to the closest neighbor species)
reads: (rarefied) total number of reads in each species
size: size category 1 (0 to 2mm), 2 (2 to 4mm), 3 (4 to 7mm), and 4 (larger than 7mm); thus this is "ordinal scale" (not quantitative variable)
island: the number of islands that each species was sampled. Sampling was done in BigIsland, Maui, Oahu, Molokai, and Kauai.
